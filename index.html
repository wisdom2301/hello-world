      <h1>Anonymous</h1>
      <p><mark><strong>Anonymous</strong> means a person unknown. Alcoholics <strong>Anonymous</strong> takes its name from the fact
          that it's a confidential group––people <br>use only their first names and do not identify one another as members of 
          the group. <br>Another related meaning of <i>anonymous</i> is to describe something that does not 
          have any special qualities.</mark></p>
